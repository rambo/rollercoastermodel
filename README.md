rollercoastermodel
==================

Schematics and Arduino code related to a model rollercoaster

This was done to help Stadi Mallarit to raise some money by building the model
to company X (I'll check later if they want their name released).

I ran out of time so some features (like adjusting each LED channel via the menu)
are not implemented at all, and the state machine for the menu in general is a bit
of a mess. It does work though.

The reason for some "weirdness" in the schematics of the IO boards is that those
were built on veroboard (in retrospect it would have been faster to make proper boards
even with all the drilling involved).

If I end up doing this menu thing better in some other project I'll come back here
and add a link, meanwhile: Be brave even if it looks like a horrible mess, there is some
decent stuff hidden in there.
